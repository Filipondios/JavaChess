# You can add your custom themes in this file, following the next requisites:
# A theme is a combination of a ID (the name of the theme), a light and a dark color.
#
# Since creating colors in Java is made with the RGB system, we need to know the three
# numbers (R,G,B) that represents that color.
#
# An example of a theme would be: BoardTheme 1r2g3b 4r5g6b
# Where 'BoardTheme' is the theme ID or name, and the colors of the theme are: Light=(1,2,3),
# dark=(4,5,6).
