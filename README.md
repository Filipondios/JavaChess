<!-- About the app -->
<a name="about"></a>
## About :book:
<p>Chess is that kind of board game that we all have played once in our lives. Who could imagine that 6 different pieces with a few rules could be
that complicated, at the point that with a normal pc, the time for this to generate all the possible moves and combinations in a chess game would
last aproximately the same time that ages the univesre has.<p>

<p>Anyway, this chess game is made for 2 players, and it won't have an AI at this moment. Maybe in later versions of the game, JavaChess would have an AI like <a href="https://github.com/Filipondios/TicTacToe">my TicTacToe</a> game has, but you'll need to wait a bit...<p>
